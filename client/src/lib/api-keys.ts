/**
 * API Key Management Module
 * 
 * SECURITY NOTICE:
 * ================
 * This module stores API keys in browser localStorage, which has security implications:
 * 
 * RISKS:
 * - Keys are vulnerable to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
 * - Keys are visible in browser DevTools
 * - Keys persist until explicitly cleared
 * 
 * MITIGATIONS:
 * - Deploy with Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
 * - Always use HTTPS in production
 * - Users should clear keys when not actively using the application
 * - Input sanitization prevents malformed data (but NOT XSS prevention)
 * 
 * DESIGN RATIONALE:
 * - User-controlled: Each user provides their own API keys
 * - Privacy-first: No server-side key storage or logging
 * - Transparent: Users can inspect keys in DevTools
 * - Self-hosted friendly: No centralized key management
 * 
 * For enterprise deployments, consider:
 * - Server-side key encryption with user authentication
 * - Browser extension for key management
 * - Environment-based key injection
 * 
 * See SECURITY.md for full security documentation.

 * - Clear keys when finished using the application

 * - Monitor your AI provider billing for unexpected usage
