Product Feature Summary: AI Middleware & Analysis Tool (Version 2)
1. Frontend User Interface (UI)

Primary Chat Interface:

A standard text input box for users to enter their prompts.

A conversation history view that displays the user's prompts and the final AI-generated responses.

Real-Time Analysis & Logging Dashboard:

A dedicated panel, visible alongside the chat interface, that updates in real-time as the middleware processes a request.

Data Display Fields: This panel must have clearly labeled, distinct fields that are populated with the following data:

Intent: The identified goal of the user's prompt.

Sentiment: The detected sentiment (e.g., positive, neutral, negative).

Style: The inferred preferred response style (e.g., formal, casual).

Security Score: The 0-10 risk rating of the user's prompt.

Selected Model: The name of the AI model chosen for the task.

Optimized Prompt: The full text of the rewritten/optimized prompt being sent to the AI model.

Parameters: The key-value pairs of the model parameters being used (e.g., temperature: 0.7, top_p: 1.0).

Real-time Process Log:

A scrolling log or feed within the dashboard that provides a step-by-step transcript of the middleware's actions as they happen.

Example log entries: "Analyzing user prompt...", "Sentiment detected: Neutral", "Security risk assessed: 1/10", "Model selected: ModelB-Technical", "Optimizing prompt...", "Sending request to model...", "Response received from model...", "Validating response...", "Validation passed.", "Displaying final response."

2. Middleware Engine: Pre-Processing Pipeline (Analyzes User Prompt)

Step 1: Intent & Sentiment Analysis:

Determines the user's primary goal (e.g., "summarize text," "write code," "answer a question").

Analyzes the sentiment of the prompt (positive, neutral, negative).

Infers the user's preferred response style (e.g., formal, casual, detailed, concise).

Step 2: Security & Risk Analysis (User Prompt):

Rates the user's prompt on a scale of 0-10 for potential security risks, including harmful content, bias, or attempts to exploit the system.

Generates a brief justification for the score.

Step 3: Optimal AI Model Selection:

Based on the intent, sentiment, and security analysis, selects the most appropriate AI model from a predefined list (e.g., a model for creative tasks, a model for technical questions, a "Deep Research" model).

Step 4: Dynamic Prompt Optimization:

Rewrites the original user prompt to be clearer, more specific, and optimized for the selected AI model.

This step should incorporate the analysis from the previous steps (e.g., adding instructions for the LLM to be more empathetic if the sentiment was negative).

Step 5: Parameter Tuning:

Adjusts the selected model's parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p) for an optimal response based on the analysis (e.g., higher temperature for creative tasks, lower for factual recall).

Step 6: "Deep Research" User Confirmation Flow:

If the "Deep Research" model is selected, the system must estimate the required time.

It must then pause the process and prompt the user for confirmation (e.g., "This request may take up to 5 minutes. Do you wish to proceed?"), allowing them to agree or choose a faster alternative.

3. Middleware Engine: Response Generation

Sends the optimized prompt and tuned parameters to the selected AI model to generate a response.

4. Middleware Engine: Post-Processing Pipeline (Analyzes AI Response)

Step 1: Response Validation:

Evaluates whether the AI's response accurately and completely addresses the user's original intent.

If the response is poor or insufficient, the system must trigger a refinement loop, potentially by refining the prompt based on the validation feedback and trying again.

Step 2: Security & Risk Analysis (AI Response):

Rates the AI-generated response on a scale of 0-10 for potential security concerns.

5. Backend & Data

Historical Logging:

A database must be used to keep a complete history of every interaction.

Each log entry must include:

Timestamp

Original user prompt

All data from the pre-processing pipeline (intent, sentiment, style, security score, selected model, optimized prompt, parameters)

The final AI-generated response

All data from the post-processing pipeline (validation status, security score)
